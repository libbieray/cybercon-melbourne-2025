- **PresentationSchedule Model**: Sophisticated scheduling with conflict detection, timing management, and special requirements
- **ScheduleConflict Model**: Automated conflict detection and resolution tracking

### 2. Flask Application Architecture

#### Core Configuration
- **CORS Support**: Enabled for frontend-backend communication
- **Security Configuration**: JWT secrets, file upload limits, and security headers
- **Database Configuration**: SQLite with proper connection management
- **Upload Directory Structure**: Organized file storage with security considerations

#### Database Initialization
- **Automatic Schema Creation**: Complete database table creation on first run
- **Default Role Setup**: Automatic creation of admin, manager, and speaker roles with appropriate permissions
- **Admin User Creation**: Default administrator account for system bootstrap
- **Audit Trail Initialization**: Logging system ready for security monitoring

### 3. Security Features Implemented

#### Data Protection
- **Password Hashing**: Werkzeug-based secure password storage
- **File Integrity**: SHA-256 hash verification for all uploaded files
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with granular control
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking for security monitoring

#### Database Security
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper referential integrity enforcement
- **Input Validation**: Model-level validation for data integrity
- **Relationship Security**: Explicit foreign key definitions to prevent ambiguity
- **Cascade Controls**: Proper deletion cascading to maintain data consistency

## System Capabilities

### User Management

- Secure authentication with MFA support
- Email verification workflow
- Comprehensive user profiles with organizational information
- Role assignment and permission management

### Presentation Workflow
- Complete presentation submission process
- Multi-version file management
- Security scanning integration points
- Review assignment and tracking
- Approval workflow with detailed feedback
- Scheduling with conflict detection

### Administrative Features
- System-wide configuration management
- User and role administration

## Technical Specifications

### Database Schema
- **11 Core Tables**: Users, Roles, Presentations, Files, Reviews, Comments, Assignments, TimeSlots, Schedules, Conflicts, AuditLogs
- **Relationship Integrity**: Proper foreign key constraints with explicit join conditions
- **Scalability Design**: Indexed fields and optimized query patterns
- **Data Types**: JSON support for flexible configuration and permissions

### File Management
- **Upload Security**: File type validation, size limits, and malware scanning hooks
- **Version Control**: Complete file history with rollback capabilities
- **Access Control**: Secure file serving with permission checking
- **Storage Organization**: Structured directory layout for different file types

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Optimized relationship loading to prevent N+1 queries
- **Indexing Strategy**: Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Caching Ready**: Architecture prepared for caching layer implementation

## Default System Configuration

### Administrator Account
- **Email**: admin@cybercon2025.com
- **Password**: CyberconAdmin2025! (must be changed immediately)
- **Permissions**: Full system access including user management, presentation oversight, and system administration

### Default Roles
- **Admin**: Complete system control with all permissions
- **Manager**: Presentation review, approval, and scheduling capabilities
- **Speaker**: Presentation submission and profile management

### Security Settings
- **File Upload Limit**: 100MB maximum file size
- **JWT Configuration**: Secure token-based authentication ready
- **CORS Policy**: Configured for frontend integration
- **Audit Logging**: All significant actions tracked

## Next Steps
Phase 3 will focus on implementing the authentication and security layer, including:
- JWT-based authentication system
- Multi-factor authentication
- Session management
- Security middleware
- API endpoint protection

The database foundation is now complete and ready to support the full application functionality.
