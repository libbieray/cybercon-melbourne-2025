## System Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements

#### Speaker Role Requirements

The speaker role represents the primary content creators for the Cybercon Melbourne 2025 conference. These users require a streamlined interface for submitting their presentation materials and managing their speaker profiles. Speakers must be able to create secure accounts using industry-standard authentication mechanisms, ensuring that their personal information and presentation materials remain protected throughout the submission process.

The presentation submission workflow for speakers encompasses multiple file format support, including PowerPoint presentations (PPTX), PDF documents, and potentially multimedia files such as videos or interactive demonstrations. The system must validate file types, scan for malicious content, and enforce reasonable file size limits to prevent abuse while accommodating legitimate presentation needs. Speakers should be able to upload multiple versions of their presentations, with the system maintaining a clear version history and allowing them to designate which version should be considered for review.

Speaker profile management represents another critical functional requirement. Speakers must be able to provide comprehensive biographical information, including their professional background, areas of expertise, contact information, and any special requirements for their presentations. This information feeds directly into the conference planning process and helps managers make informed decisions about presentation scheduling and logistics. The system should support rich text formatting for speaker biographies and allow for the upload of professional headshots and other relevant media.

The speaker dashboard must provide real-time visibility into the status of submitted presentations, including whether they are under review, have been approved, require revisions, or have been scheduled for specific time slots. Speakers should receive automated notifications at key milestones in the review process, ensuring they remain informed about the progress of their submissions without requiring constant manual checking of the system.

#### Manager Role Requirements

Managers represent the core review and approval authority within the system, responsible for evaluating speaker submissions and making decisions about their inclusion in the conference program. The manager role requires sophisticated workflow management capabilities that enable efficient review processes while maintaining detailed audit trails of all decisions and communications.

The presentation review interface must provide managers with comprehensive tools for evaluating submissions. This includes the ability to view presentations directly within the web browser using embedded viewers that support multiple file formats, download presentations for offline review when necessary, and access all associated speaker information in a unified interface. Managers need the capability to add detailed comments and feedback to presentations, both for internal coordination with other managers and for communication back to speakers when revisions are required.

The approval workflow system must support multiple decision states for each presentation, including pending review, under evaluation, approved, conditionally approved (requiring minor revisions), rejected, and scheduled. Each state transition should be logged with timestamps and manager identification, creating a complete audit trail of the review process. Managers should be able to assign presentations to specific time slots, manage scheduling conflicts, and coordinate with other managers to ensure balanced programming across the conference agenda.

Collaboration features represent a critical requirement for the manager role, as conference programming decisions often require input from multiple stakeholders. The system must support internal commenting systems that allow managers to discuss presentations privately, share expertise about specific technical topics, and coordinate their review efforts. Managers should be able to flag presentations for additional review, request input from subject matter experts, and escalate complex decisions to administrators when necessary.

#### Administrator Role Requirements

The administrator role encompasses the highest level of system access and responsibility, combining all manager capabilities with additional user management and system configuration functions. Administrators serve as the primary system operators and are responsible for maintaining the overall health and security of the platform throughout the conference planning cycle.

User management capabilities for administrators must include the ability to create, modify, and deactivate user accounts across all roles. This includes the complex task of managing manager assignments, where administrators must be able to allocate specific presentations or presentation categories to individual managers based on their expertise and availability. The system should support flexible assignment mechanisms, including automatic distribution based on predefined criteria and manual assignment for special cases or sensitive presentations.

System configuration and maintenance represent ongoing responsibilities for administrators. This includes managing system-wide settings such as file upload limits, supported file formats, notification preferences, and security policies. Administrators must have access to comprehensive system logs and analytics that provide insights into system usage, performance metrics, and potential security concerns. The ability to generate reports on submission volumes, review timelines, and approval rates helps administrators optimize the system for future conferences and identify areas for improvement.

Emergency response capabilities are essential for the administrator role, particularly given the sensitive nature of cybersecurity presentations and the potential for targeted attacks on conference systems. Administrators must be able to quickly disable user accounts, remove problematic content, implement emergency security measures, and coordinate with technical support teams when security incidents occur. The system should provide administrators with real-time alerts about suspicious activities, failed authentication attempts, and other potential security indicators.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Security Requirements

Security represents the paramount concern for the Cybercon Melbourne 2025 Speaker Presentation Management System, given the sensitive nature of cybersecurity research and the high-profile target that such a system represents. The security architecture must implement defense-in-depth principles, ensuring that multiple layers of protection safeguard both the system infrastructure and the valuable intellectual property contained within speaker presentations.

Authentication security must implement industry-standard protocols including multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts, particularly those with elevated privileges such as managers and administrators. Password policies should enforce strong password requirements including minimum length, complexity requirements, and regular rotation schedules. The system must implement account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute force attacks while providing legitimate users with clear recovery procedures. Session management should include automatic timeout features, secure session token generation, and protection against session hijacking attacks.

Data encryption requirements encompass both data at rest and data in transit. All presentation files and sensitive user information must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption when stored in the database or file system. Network communications must utilize TLS 1.3 or higher for all client-server interactions, ensuring that sensitive data cannot be intercepted during transmission. Database connections should implement encrypted channels, and any backup or archival processes must maintain the same encryption standards as the primary system.

Access control implementation must follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users can only access the specific resources and functions necessary for their role. Role-based access control (RBAC) should be implemented with granular permissions that can be adjusted based on specific organizational needs. The system must maintain detailed audit logs of all access attempts, successful and failed authentication events, and any changes to user permissions or system configurations. These logs should be tamper-evident and stored in a secure, centralized logging system that supports forensic analysis if security incidents occur.

File upload security represents a particularly critical area given the potential for malicious files to be uploaded under the guise of legitimate presentations. The system must implement comprehensive file scanning including antivirus scanning, malware detection, and content validation to ensure that uploaded files contain only legitimate presentation content. File type restrictions should be enforced at multiple levels, including MIME type validation, file extension verification, and deep content analysis to prevent disguised executable files or other malicious content.

#### Performance Requirements

The performance characteristics of the speaker presentation management system must accommodate the concentrated usage patterns typical of conference submission deadlines while maintaining responsive user experiences across all system functions. Peak load scenarios occur during submission deadline periods when hundreds of speakers may attempt to upload presentations simultaneously, requiring the system architecture to handle significant spikes in both network traffic and storage operations.

Response time requirements should target sub-second response times for standard user interface operations such as navigation, form submissions, and data retrieval. File upload operations represent a special case where response times depend heavily on file size and network conditions, but the system should provide clear progress indicators and estimated completion times to maintain user confidence during longer operations. Presentation viewing operations must load within reasonable timeframes, with initial page rendering occurring within two seconds and full presentation content available within five seconds for typical file sizes.

Scalability requirements must address both horizontal and vertical scaling scenarios. The system architecture should support horizontal scaling through load balancing and distributed processing capabilities, allowing additional server resources to be added during peak usage periods. Database performance must be optimized through appropriate indexing strategies, query optimization, and potentially read replica configurations to handle increased query loads during busy periods. File storage systems should implement distributed storage solutions that can scale to accommodate growing volumes of presentation files while maintaining consistent access performance.

Concurrent user support should accommodate at least 500 simultaneous active users during peak periods, with the ability to scale to 1000 or more users if conference participation exceeds expectations. The system must maintain stable performance characteristics even under maximum load conditions, with graceful degradation of non-essential features if necessary to preserve core functionality during extreme usage spikes.

#### Reliability and Availability Requirements

System availability requirements for the Cybercon Melbourne 2025 Speaker Presentation Management System must reflect the critical nature of conference planning timelines and the potential impact of system outages on speaker submissions and review processes. The target availability should be 99.9% uptime during active conference planning periods, with planned maintenance windows scheduled during low-usage periods and communicated well in advance to all stakeholders.

Data backup and recovery procedures must ensure that no presentation submissions or review data can be lost due to system failures or other technical issues. Automated backup systems should create multiple copies of all critical data, including presentation files, user accounts, review comments, and system configurations. Backup frequency should be at least daily for all data, with more frequent backups during peak submission periods. Recovery procedures must be tested regularly to ensure that data can be restored quickly and completely in the event of system failures.

Disaster recovery planning must address various failure scenarios including hardware failures, network outages, security breaches, and natural disasters that could impact system availability. The disaster recovery plan should include detailed procedures for system restoration, alternative access methods for critical users, and communication protocols for notifying stakeholders about system status during outage events. Recovery time objectives should target system restoration within four hours for major outages, with critical functions potentially available sooner through backup systems or manual processes.

Monitoring and alerting systems must provide real-time visibility into system health and performance metrics. Automated monitoring should track server performance, database responsiveness, file system capacity, network connectivity, and security indicators. Alert systems should notify administrators immediately when performance thresholds are exceeded, security events are detected, or system components fail. Monitoring data should be retained for analysis and trending to support capacity planning and performance optimization efforts.


## System Architecture

### Overall Architecture Design

The Cybercon Melbourne 2025 Speaker Presentation Management System employs a modern three-tier architecture that separates presentation logic, business logic, and data storage into distinct layers. This architectural approach provides several key advantages including improved maintainability, enhanced security through layer isolation, and the flexibility to scale individual components based on specific performance requirements.

The presentation tier consists of a React-based single-page application (SPA) that provides a responsive, interactive user interface optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. This frontend application communicates exclusively with the backend through a well-defined REST API, ensuring clean separation of concerns and enabling potential future development of alternative client applications such as mobile apps or third-party integrations. The React application implements client-side routing, state management through Redux or Context API, and comprehensive form validation to provide users with immediate feedback and reduce server load.

The business logic tier is implemented using Flask, a lightweight yet powerful Python web framework that provides the flexibility needed to implement complex business rules while maintaining the security features essential for handling sensitive presentation materials. The Flask application serves as the primary API gateway, implementing authentication and authorization middleware, request validation, business rule enforcement, and integration with external services such as file storage and email notification systems. This tier also handles the complex workflow logic required for presentation review and approval processes.

The data tier utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary database system, chosen for its robust ACID compliance, advanced security features, and excellent performance characteristics under concurrent load. The database design implements proper normalization to ensure data integrity while maintaining query performance through strategic indexing and view optimization. File storage is handled through a separate file system layer that implements encryption at rest and integrates with the database through secure reference mechanisms.

### Technology Stack Selection

#### Frontend Technologies

React serves as the foundation for the user interface, selected for its component-based architecture that promotes code reusability and maintainability. The React ecosystem provides extensive libraries for common functionality such as form handling, routing, and state management, reducing development time while ensuring robust, well-tested implementations. React's virtual DOM implementation provides excellent performance characteristics even with complex user interfaces, while its extensive community support ensures long-term viability and security updates.

The user interface design implements Material-UI or a similar component library to ensure consistent, professional appearance across all system functions while providing accessibility features required for inclusive design. CSS-in-JS solutions such as styled-components enable dynamic styling based on user roles and system state, while maintaining the performance benefits of compiled CSS. The frontend build process utilizes modern tooling including Webpack for module bundling, Babel for JavaScript transpilation, and ESLint for code quality enforcement.

State management within the React application utilizes Redux Toolkit for complex application state that must be shared across multiple components, while leveraging React's built-in useState and useContext hooks for simpler, localized state management. This hybrid approach provides the benefits of centralized state management where needed while avoiding the complexity overhead for simple component interactions. API communication is handled through Axios or the native Fetch API with custom hooks that provide consistent error handling and loading state management.

#### Backend Technologies

Flask provides the backend framework, chosen for its simplicity, flexibility, and strong security ecosystem. Flask's modular design allows for the implementation of custom middleware for authentication, authorization, and request logging while maintaining clean separation between different system concerns. The Flask application utilizes Blueprint architecture to organize API endpoints logically and support future expansion of system functionality.

SQLAlchemy serves as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer, providing database abstraction that simplifies complex queries while maintaining the ability to optimize performance-critical operations through raw SQL when necessary. SQLAlchemy's migration system through Alembic ensures that database schema changes can be managed systematically across development, testing, and production environments. The ORM configuration implements connection pooling and query optimization features to maintain performance under concurrent load.

Authentication and authorization are implemented using Flask-JWT-Extended for JSON Web Token management, providing stateless authentication that scales well across multiple server instances. Password hashing utilizes bcrypt or Argon2 algorithms to ensure that user credentials remain secure even if database access is compromised. Role-based access control is implemented through custom decorators that integrate with the JWT system to provide fine-grained permission checking at the API endpoint level.

File handling utilizes Flask-Uploads or similar libraries to manage secure file upload processes, including file type validation, size limits, and malware scanning integration. Uploaded files are stored in a secure directory structure with randomized filenames to prevent direct access while maintaining organized storage for administrative purposes. File serving implements access control checks to ensure that only authorized users can download or view specific presentations.

#### Database Design

PostgreSQL serves as the primary database system, providing the ACID compliance and advanced security features necessary for handling sensitive conference data. The database design implements proper normalization to third normal form while maintaining denormalized views for performance-critical queries such as dashboard displays and reporting functions. Indexing strategies are carefully planned to support both transactional operations and analytical queries without creating excessive maintenance overhead.

The user management schema implements separate tables for user accounts, roles, and permissions with many-to-many relationships that support flexible role assignment and permission management. User authentication data is stored separately from profile information to enable different security policies for different data types. Audit logging is implemented through database triggers and separate audit tables that maintain immutable records of all significant system events.

Presentation management utilizes a hierarchical table structure that supports multiple file versions, review comments, and approval workflow states. Foreign key relationships ensure referential integrity while cascade delete policies protect against orphaned records. The schema design supports complex queries for reporting and analytics while maintaining transactional integrity for critical operations such as approval status changes and file uploads.

### Security Architecture

#### Authentication and Authorization Framework

The authentication system implements a multi-layered approach that begins with secure user registration processes including email verification and strong password requirements. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented using time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) through applications such as Google Authenticator or Authy, providing an additional security layer that significantly reduces the risk of account compromise even if passwords are leaked.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) provide the primary authentication mechanism for API access, with tokens containing minimal user identification information and role assignments. Token expiration is set to reasonable timeframes (typically 1-4 hours) to limit the impact of token compromise while providing refresh token mechanisms that enable seamless user experience for legitimate users. Token blacklisting capabilities ensure that compromised tokens can be immediately invalidated across all system components.

Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented through a flexible permission system that maps user roles to specific system capabilities. The permission system supports both positive permissions (explicitly granted access) and negative permissions (explicitly denied access) to handle complex organizational requirements. Permission checking occurs at multiple levels including API endpoint access, data filtering, and user interface element visibility to ensure consistent security enforcement.

#### Data Protection Measures

All sensitive data including presentation files, user personal information, and system configuration data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption with keys managed through a secure key management system. Database encryption is implemented at the column level for the most sensitive data types while utilizing full database encryption for comprehensive protection. Encryption key rotation procedures ensure that long-term data exposure is minimized even if individual keys are compromised.

Network security implements TLS 1.3 for all client-server communications with proper certificate management and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers to prevent protocol downgrade attacks. API endpoints implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and distributed denial of service attacks while maintaining reasonable access for legitimate users. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies are carefully configured to allow necessary frontend access while preventing unauthorized cross-domain requests.

File upload security implements multiple validation layers including MIME type checking, file extension validation, and content scanning to prevent malicious file uploads. Uploaded files are stored in a secure directory structure outside the web server document root with access controlled through application logic rather than direct web server access. Antivirus scanning integration provides real-time malware detection for all uploaded content.

#### Audit and Monitoring Systems

Comprehensive audit logging captures all significant system events including user authentication, authorization decisions, data access, and administrative actions. Audit logs are stored in a tamper-evident format with cryptographic signatures that enable detection of unauthorized modifications. Log retention policies ensure that audit data is available for security analysis and compliance requirements while managing storage costs through automated archival processes.

Real-time monitoring systems track system performance, security events, and user behavior patterns to identify potential security threats or system issues. Automated alerting notifies administrators of suspicious activities such as repeated failed authentication attempts, unusual file access patterns, or system performance degradation. Security information and event management (SIEM) integration provides centralized security monitoring and correlation with other organizational security systems.

Intrusion detection capabilities monitor for common attack patterns including SQL injection attempts, cross-site scripting attacks, and unauthorized access attempts. Behavioral analysis identifies unusual user activity patterns that may indicate compromised accounts or insider threats. Incident response procedures provide clear escalation paths and communication protocols for addressing security events quickly and effectively.


## Database Schema Design

### Core Entity Relationships

The database schema for the Cybercon Melbourne 2025 Speaker Presentation Management System implements a carefully normalized design that balances data integrity with query performance. The core entities include Users, Presentations, Reviews, Comments, Schedules, and various supporting tables that maintain referential integrity while supporting complex business workflows.

The Users table serves as the central entity for all system authentication and authorization functions. This table stores essential user information including encrypted passwords, email addresses, account status, and creation timestamps. The design separates authentication data from profile information to enable different security policies and access patterns. User roles are managed through a separate UserRoles table that implements a many-to-many relationship, allowing users to have multiple roles if organizational requirements change over time.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
