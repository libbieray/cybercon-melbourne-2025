### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Security Decorators and Middleware
- **Role-Based Access**: `@require_role()` decorator for endpoint protection

- **Session Model**: Complete session submission with primary speaker, additional speakers, session type, and upload comments
- **SessionSpeaker Model**: Support for multiple speakers per session with roles
- **SessionFile Model**: Secure file upload with version control and integrity checking

#### Communication and Q&A System
- **SessionQuestion Model**: Speaker questions with urgency flags and status tracking
- **SessionQuestionResponse Model**: Approver responses with internal/external visibility
- **FAQ Model**: Comprehensive FAQ management with categories and ordering
- **BroadcastMessage Model**: Admin broadcast messaging to speakers with delivery tracking

- **SessionReview Model**: Updated review system for session approval/rejection
- **SessionAssignment Model**: Assignment of sessions to specific approvers
- **Room and SessionSchedule Models**: Complete scheduling system with room management

### 4. Enhanced Security Architecture

#### Authentication Security
- **JWT Configuration**: Secure token generation with configurable expiration times
- **Token Blacklisting**: Secure logout with token invalidation
- **MFA Integration**: TOTP-based multi-factor authentication with QR code generation
- **Session Security**: Comprehensive session management with security monitoring

#### Data Protection
- **Password Hashing**: Werkzeug-based secure password storage
- **File Integrity**: SHA-256 hash verification for all uploaded files
- **Access Control**: Granular permission system with role-based restrictions
- **Audit Trails**: Complete activity logging for security compliance

#### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- **Security Headers**: Complete security header implementation
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks
