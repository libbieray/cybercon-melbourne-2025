## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

Understanding common system issues and their solutions helps you resolve problems quickly and minimise disruption to your conference activities. Most issues can be resolved through simple troubleshooting steps that do not require technical support intervention.

#### Login and Authentication Issues

Login problems are among the most common issues users experience and can usually be resolved through systematic troubleshooting steps. Before contacting technical support, try these common solutions to restore access to your account.

Password-related issues often occur when users forget their passwords or enter incorrect credentials. Use the password reset function to create a new password, ensuring that you check your email spam folder for the reset message. When creating a new password, ensure it meets the system's complexity requirements including minimum length and character variety.

Browser-related authentication issues can occur when cookies are disabled, browser cache is corrupted, or outdated browser versions are used. Clear your browser cache and cookies, ensure JavaScript is enabled, and try accessing the system using a different browser or incognito mode to isolate browser-specific issues.

Account lockout situations occur after multiple failed login attempts and are designed to protect against unauthorised access. If your account is locked, wait 30 minutes before attempting to log in again, or use the password reset function to regain immediate access.

Multi-factor authentication issues can prevent access even when passwords are correct. Ensure your authenticator application is synchronised with the correct time, try generating a new authentication code, and verify that you are using the correct authenticator account for the system.

#### File Upload and Management Issues

File upload problems can be frustrating but are usually caused by common issues that can be resolved through systematic troubleshooting. Understanding these issues helps you identify and resolve problems quickly.

File size limitations are the most common cause of upload failures. Ensure your files are under the 100MB limit and consider compressing large files or splitting content across multiple files if necessary. The system displays file size information during the upload process to help you identify oversized files.

File format compatibility issues occur when unsupported file types are uploaded. Verify that your files are in supported formats (PDF, PPT, PPTX, MP4, MOV) and consider converting files to supported formats if necessary. The system validates file types during upload and provides clear error messages for unsupported formats.

Network connectivity problems can cause upload failures or timeouts, particularly for large files. Ensure you have a stable internet connection, avoid uploading during peak network usage times, and consider using a wired connection instead of wireless for large file uploads.

Browser compatibility issues can affect file upload functionality, particularly with older browsers or those with disabled JavaScript. Try using a different browser, ensure JavaScript is enabled, and clear browser cache if upload problems persist.

#### Notification and Communication Issues

Notification problems can prevent you from receiving important updates about your submissions and conference activities. Most notification issues can be resolved through preference adjustments and email configuration checks.

Missing email notifications are often caused by spam filters, incorrect email addresses, or disabled notification preferences. Check your spam folder for system emails, verify that your email address is correct in your profile, and review your notification preferences to ensure appropriate notifications are enabled.

Delayed notifications can occur during periods of high system activity or email server issues. The system queues notifications during peak periods and delivers them as resources become available. If notifications are consistently delayed, contact technical support for investigation.

In-application notification issues may be caused by browser settings, disabled JavaScript, or cached page content. Refresh your browser page, clear browser cache, and ensure JavaScript is enabled to restore notification functionality.

Notification preference changes may not take effect immediately due to system caching. Allow up to one hour for preference changes to be fully implemented, and contact technical support if changes do not take effect within this timeframe.

#### Performance and Accessibility Issues

System performance issues can affect your ability to use the platform efficiently and may indicate browser, network, or system-related problems. Understanding common performance issues helps you identify and resolve problems quickly.

Slow page loading can be caused by network connectivity issues, browser problems, or high system load. Try refreshing the page, clearing browser cache, using a different browser, or accessing the system during off-peak hours to improve performance.

Unresponsive interface elements may indicate JavaScript errors, browser compatibility issues, or corrupted page content. Refresh the page, try using a different browser, and ensure JavaScript is enabled to restore interface functionality.

Display formatting issues can occur with certain browser configurations, screen resolutions, or accessibility settings. Try adjusting browser zoom levels, using a different browser, or modifying accessibility settings to improve display quality.

Mobile device compatibility problems may occur with older devices or operating systems. Ensure your mobile device meets minimum system requirements and consider using a desktop computer for complex tasks such as file uploads or detailed form completion.

### Error Messages and Resolution Steps

Understanding common error messages and their meanings helps you take appropriate action to resolve issues or provide useful information to technical support staff when assistance is needed.

Authentication error messages typically indicate problems with login credentials, account status, or session management. Common messages include "Invalid username or password," "Account locked," and "Session expired." These messages usually require password reset, account unlock, or re-authentication to resolve.

File upload error messages provide specific information about upload failures and required corrective actions. Messages such as "File too large," "Unsupported file type," and "Upload timeout" indicate specific issues that can be resolved by modifying file properties or upload conditions.

Permission error messages indicate that you are attempting to access features or content that exceed your authorisation level. These messages typically require role adjustment by administrators or confirmation that you are accessing appropriate system areas.

System error messages may indicate temporary technical issues or more serious system problems. Note the exact error message text and any error codes, try refreshing the page or logging out and back in, and contact technical support if errors persist.

### Escalation Procedures

When troubleshooting steps do not resolve your issues, escalation procedures ensure that you receive appropriate technical assistance and that problems are addressed efficiently. Understanding these procedures helps you get the help you need whilst providing useful information to support staff.

Initial escalation involves contacting technical support through email with detailed information about your issue, troubleshooting steps you have already attempted, and any error messages you have encountered. Include screenshots or screen recordings if they help illustrate the problem.

Priority escalation is available for issues that significantly impact your ability to meet conference deadlines or participate in critical activities. Clearly indicate the urgency of your issue and explain how it affects your conference participation when requesting priority assistance.

Administrative escalation may be necessary for issues involving account permissions, policy questions, or conflicts with other users. These issues are typically handled by conference administrators rather than technical support staff and may require additional time for investigation and resolution.

Emergency escalation procedures are available for critical issues that affect system availability or security. Use emergency contacts only for genuine emergencies that cannot wait for normal support response times, and be prepared to provide detailed information about the nature and scope of the emergency.
